# RAPID-SI VE11 toolbox

RAPID-SI sequence based data processing toolbox for MRSI, which allows researchers to perform spectroscopy with reduced acquisition time as compared to conventional CSI maintaining metabolite information. 
The toolbox is easy to install and to use : 
1) Loads spctroscopy data obtained from Siemens twix tool in .dat format. The codes are adapted for the latest VE11 SIEMENS IDEA platform. 
2) allowing pre-processing of multi-voxel spectra, 
3) perform nonlinear least squares iterative data fitting and get metabolite maps. 

### Run the GUI tool  
In order to run the tool, you need to have Matlab installed. Second, use rapid_start.m file to start the tool. Please refer to the HELP.docx file included in the package for the data processing part
